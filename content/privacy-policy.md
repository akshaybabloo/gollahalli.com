# Privacy Policy

**Last Updated:** 18th October 2023

## 1. Introduction

This privacy policy is designed to inform you, the reader, about the data collection practices associated with this website. While I don't directly collect personal data, third-party services I use might do so. The primary third-party service in question is Google Ads.

## 2. Google Ads Data Collection

I use Google Ads to serve advertisements on this blog. Google Ads, operated by Google, uses cookies and other tracking technologies to serve tailored ads based on user behavior and preferences. These technologies may collect information, including but not limited to, IP addresses, device identifiers, browser types, and browsing patterns.

## 3. Cookies

Please see my [Cookie Policy]({{< ref "/cookie-policy" >}} "Cookie Policy") for more information about the cookies we use.

## 4. Opting Out of Personalized Advertising

If you wish to opt out of personalized advertising from Google, you can do so by visiting [Google's Ad Settings](https://www.google.com/settings/ads). Opting out won't remove ads, but it will make them less relevant to your interests.

## 5. External Links

My blog posts may occasionally contain links to external websites. I'm not responsible for the content or privacy practices of these external sites. I encourage you to exercise caution and review the privacy policies of any external websites you visit.

## 6. Changes to This Privacy Policy

I may update this privacy policy from time to time to reflect changes in my practices or for other operational, legal, or regulatory reasons. Any updates will be posted on this page, so I encourage you to periodically review this privacy policy.

## 7. Contact Me

If you have any questions or concerns regarding this privacy policy, please contact me at [akshay@gollahalli.com](mailto:akshay@gollahalli.com).
