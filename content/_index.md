Hello my fellow comp-sci geeks, my name is Akshay. I'm currently defying testosterone laws and multi-tasking, working as a Software Engineer and running to the finish line to complete my PhD in Computational Neuroscience using Spiking Neural Network. In my down time, I enjoy writing blogs for my peers, develop open-source softwares, or daydream.
