Node's package managers makes it easy to develop applications, but the bloat it brings with it is (that's node_modules) painful. My 2013 Mac with 256 GB HDD cannot handle it. I currently have around eight projects that use `yarn` package manager and the total size of all `node_modules` comes to around **~2.2GB**. And lets not even get to the cache folder (Tip: `yarn cache clean`). All the hate for `node_modules` is totally justified.

All I want to do is to delete all unused `node_modules` folders (we all think that we will get back to it at some point but we never do), and there are different ways to do it:

1. Go to each project and delete the `node_modules` folder
2. Use one of the following shell scripts:
   1. Windows:
    ```sh
    FOR /d /r . %d in (node_modules) DO @IF EXIST "%d" rm -rf "%d"
    ```
   2. Linux:
    ```sh
    find . -name 'node_modules' -type d -prune -print -exec rm -rf '{}' \;
    ```
   3. PowerShell:
    ```ps1
    Get-ChildItem -Path "." -Include "node_modules" -Recurse -Directory | Remove-Item -Recurse -Force
    ```
3. Or use [dnode](https://github.com/akshaybabloo/dnode/releases/latest):
   ```sh
   dnode delete
   ```

## Instillation

There are pre-built binaries for Windows, macOS and Linux, these can be found at the [release](https://github.com/akshaybabloo/dnode/releases/latest) page.

Or you could build one yourself:

> Note: The code depends on Go 1.17 or above

```sh
git clone https://github.com/akshaybabloo/dnode.git
cd dnode
go build -o dnode
./dnode --help
```

<!--adsense-->

## Usage

There are two commands - `list` and `delete`.

### List

`dnode list` lists all the unused `node_modules` folders in the current directory tree.
 
 Example:

{{< video src="/videos/blog/dnode-delete-node-modules-folders-recursively/dnode-list" >}}

### Delete

`dnode delete` deletes all the unused `node_modules` folders in the current directory tree.

 Example:

{{< video src="/videos/blog/dnode-delete-node-modules-folders-recursively/dnode-delete" >}}

## Final Thoughts

Again, this CLI was developed out of frustration to get rid of unused `node_modules` folders. I hope you find it useful.

Happy coding üçæ
