## About Me

My name is Akshay Raj Gollahalli (Akshay for short). I survive mostly on coffee. I am a designer, developer, software engineer, animal lover and a Ph.D. student.

In the year 1998, I went out with my mother, who is a social worker, to a free plastic surgery camp for poor in Hyderabad, India and then decided to become a doctor (a real one). That same year my father, who is an engineer, took me to a steel rolling mill, and then I decided to become an engineer. On 12th October 1999, my father bought me a computer, Intel Pentium III with 256 MB RAM (WHAT!?). I instantly fell in love with it.

My journey started with computers nearly 17 years ago, and I am very passionate about it. My interests are in research and development of Machine Learning, Neurocomputational Intelligence and Brain Computer Interface.

I constantly enjoy developing new software with functionality that would provide better user experience. I believe open sourcing software produces good and better results.

This website showcases my personal work, publications and tutorials. While you are at it, don't forget to see me blog and please feel free to contact me.
